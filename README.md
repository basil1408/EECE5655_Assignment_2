Question 2: Write a function that generates a specified number of independent and identically distributed
samples paired with the class labels that generated these samples. </br>
  Question 2.1: Number of samples = 400; class means [0,0]' and [3,3]' ; class covariance matrices both set to I; equal class priors. </br>
  Question 2.2: All parameters same as (1), but both covariance matrices changed to [3 1;1 0.8]. </br>
  Question 2.3: Number of samples = 400; class means [0,0]' and [2,2]' ; class covariance matrices [2 0.5;0.5 1] and [2 -1.9;-1.9 5]; equal                 class priors. </br>
  Question 2.4: Same (1), but prior for class priors are 0:05 and 0:95. </br>
  Question 2.5: Same (2), but prior for class priors are 0:05 and 0:95. </br>
  Question 2.6: Same (3), but prior for class priors are 0:05 and 0:95. </br>
Question 3: For the datasets you generated in Question 2, implement and apply the Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis classifier with the               decision threshold for the linear discriminant score set to minimize the smallest probability error you can achieve on the                 specific data sets generated for each case. Visualize the one-dimensional Fisher LDA discriminant scores and decision labels               for each sample in separate plots for each case.</br>
